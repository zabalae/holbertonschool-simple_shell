MAN SIMPLE_SHELL

NAME:
      simple_shell - A Simple Shell Implementation

DESCRIPTION:
       simple_shell is a basic shell program designed to provide a simple command-line
       interface for executing commands. it includes features commonly found in unix-like
       shells, such as command execution, environment variable display, and basic error handling.

OPTIONS:
       simple_shell does not currently support any command-line options.

COMMANDS:
       The simple_shell supports the following commands:

- command Execution:
  Enter any valid command to execute. The shell searches for the command in the user's
  path and executes it if found.

- Environment Variables:
  Entering the command 'env' displays the current environment variables.

EXIT STATUS:
  The simple_shell returns the following exit statuses:

  0 Successful execution.

  1 General error (e.g., invalid command syntax).

  127 The specified command is not found in the path.

USAGE:
    simple_shell can be used as a standard interactive shell or can execute
    commands from a script file.

 Interactive mode:
   Run simple_shell without any arguments to enter interactive mode.
   In this mode, you can enter commands, and the shell will execute
   them one by one. To exit the interactive mode, use the 'exit' command.

   Example:
     $ simple_shell
     $ ls -1
     ...

  Script Mode:
    You can pass a script file as an argument to simple_shell for batch execution
    of commands. The script file should contain valid shell commands, each on a new line.

   Example:
     $ simple_shell script.sh

EXAMPLES:
      1. Execute a command:
         $ simple_shell ls -1

      2. Display environment variables:
         $ simple_shell env

      3. Run a script file:
         $ simple_shell myscript.sh
